Nice project overall! 
You managed to implement the functionality you agreed on the planning session with UX/UI team. The website looks clean and professional.
I like that you always provide a clear overview of the project in the readme file. It helps to understand the project structure and the key sections of the website.
It's also amazing that the page is responsive and works well on different screen sizes. üòÅ

Improvements:

- The hero video is a great addition to the homepage. However, it's a bit distorted on larger screens. Consider adjusting the video's aspect ratio to maintain quality across different screen sizes.

- **Careful with the code provided by AI**. It's a great tool to speed up development, but always double-check the generated code to ensure it aligns with the project's requirements and make sure you understand it. There is a few redundant or not used code lines in the project.

- Delete non-used images and files from the project. It will help to keep the project clean and organized.

- Time management: Each afternoon was supposed to be divided in time for the project / time for the labs. This  forces us to switch between back and front end. This way we would have a more realistic experience of a fullstack developer and having multiple projects at the same time. 
Try to negotiate with the team to reduce the amount of work. Delivering a project with less functionality was not a problem in this case. 
Negotiation is a key skill in a developer's life.
